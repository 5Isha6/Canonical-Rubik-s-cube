1) Design a datastructure for representing the setting of a Rubik's Cube.
Python dictionary


2) Design and implement the procedure for computing the canonical form
of this datastructure. Explain clearly how this procedure works, and
what is the canonical form that you have chosen.

Swapping colors to fix for canonical form

Explain how you've broken down this problem into smaller stages.

3) Show your computed canonical form for the 17280 cube settings in
'rubiks-example.txt'.
